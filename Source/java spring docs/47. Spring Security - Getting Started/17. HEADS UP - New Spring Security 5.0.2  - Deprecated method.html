<p><strong>HEADS UP: New Spring Security 5.0.2&nbsp; - deprecated method</strong></p>

<p>The Spring Security team released Spring Security 5.0.2 on 20 Feb 2018.

</p>











<p>They deprecated the method: <code>User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder()</code>&nbsp;</p>











<p>We use this for the in-memory authentication section of the course.</p>













<p>This issue only applies to in-memory authentication.</p>









<p>But don't worry, this is okay for demo purposes (in-memory).<br></p>













<p>Later in the course we'll store user accounts in the database using encryption. As a result, this will be a non-issue (there are no deprecated methods for database storage).</p>

<p>In the following video, when you see a deprecation warning for, <code>User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder()</code>&nbsp; you can safely ignore it: because we are only using it for demo purposes.</p>
