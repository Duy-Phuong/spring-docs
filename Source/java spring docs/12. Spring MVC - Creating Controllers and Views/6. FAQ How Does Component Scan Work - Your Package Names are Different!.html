<p>How Does Component Scan Work - Your Package Names are Different!</p><p><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">Question</strong></p>

<p>How does component scan work in this example? You have different package names.</p>

<p>You listed the component scan package as: com.luv2code.springdemo</p>

<p>But the our MVC controllers are defined in com.luv2code.springdemo.mvc</p>



<p><strong>Answer</strong><br>For the Spring attribute: Â base-package="com.luv2code.springdemo"</p>

<p>Spring will recursively scan for components starting at the base package: "com.luv2code.springdemo"</p>

<p>When I say "recursive", it means that Spring will start at the base package and scan all sub packages.</p>

<p>The package com.luv2code.springdemo.mvc is a sub package because of naming structure, just like folders on a file system.</p>

<p>As a result, it will be included in the scan.</p>
