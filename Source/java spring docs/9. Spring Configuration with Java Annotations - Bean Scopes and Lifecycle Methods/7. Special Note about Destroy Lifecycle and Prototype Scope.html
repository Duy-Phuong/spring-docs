<p>Here is a subtle point you need to be aware of with "prototype" scoped beans.</p>

<p><strong>For "prototype" scoped beans, Spring does not call the @PreDestroy method.&nbsp; Gasp!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>









<p>I didn't know this either until I dug through the Spring reference manual researching a student's question.</p>













<p>Here is the answer from the Spring reference manual. Section 7.5.2</p><p><a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-factory-scopes-prototype" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" rel="nofollow">https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-factory-scopes-prototype</a><br></p><p>---










</p><p><em class="redactor-inline-converted"><strong class="redactor-inline-converted">In contrast to the other scopes, Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a<br>prototype bean</strong>: the container instantiates, configures, and otherwise assembles a<br>prototype object, and hands it to the client, with no further record of that prototype<br>instance. </em><em class="redactor-inline-converted"><br></em></p>







<p><em class="redactor-inline-converted">Thus, although initialization lifecycle callback methods are called on all objects regardless of scope, <strong class="redactor-inline-converted">in the case of prototypes, configured destruction lifecycle callbacks are not called</strong>. The client code must clean up prototype-scoped objects and release expensive resources that the prototype bean(s) are holding.&nbsp;</em></p>







<p><em class="redactor-inline-converted">To get the Spring container to release resources held by prototype-scoped beans, try using a custom <a href="https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-factory-extension-bpp" rel="nofollow">bean post-processor</a>, which holds a reference to beans that need to be cleaned up.<br></em></p>

<p><em class="redactor-inline-converted"></em>This also applies to XML configuration.<br></p>
