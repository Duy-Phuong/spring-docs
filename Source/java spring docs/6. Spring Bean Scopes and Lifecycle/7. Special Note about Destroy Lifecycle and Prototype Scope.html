<p>There is a subtle point you need to be aware of with "prototype" scoped beans.</p>

<p><strong>For "prototype" scoped beans, Spring does not call the destroy method.&nbsp; Gasp!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><br><p>---
</p>















<p><em><strong>In contrast to the other scopes, Spring does not manage the complete lifecycle of a
prototype bean</strong>: the container instantiates, configures, and otherwise assembles a
prototype object, and hands it to the client, with no further record of that prototype
instance. </em><em>
</em></p>













<p><em>Thus, although initialization lifecycle callback methods are called on all objects regardless of scope, <strong>in the case of prototypes, configured destruction lifecycle callbacks are not called</strong>.
 The client code must clean up prototype-scoped objects and release 
expensive resources that the prototype bean(s) are holding.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>This also applies to both XML configuration and Annotation-based configuration.</p>
