<p><strong>Practice Activity #3</strong><strong> - Bean Scopes with XML Configuration</strong></p>



<p><br></p>

<p>1. Add bean scopes to your new Coach implementation that you created in one of the previous activities.</p>

<p>2. Test singleton scope and prototype scope as I did in the videos.</p>

<p>3. Verify that the bean scopes are being applied as desired.
